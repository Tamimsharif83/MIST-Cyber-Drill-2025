ANSWER:
First, this file was password-protected with 7-Zip. It took a long time to crack the password because, at the start of the contest, the file signature was missing. I was trying to crack it using a dictionary attack, but the password didn't match.

I cloned this GitHub repository: https://github.com/Goron/7zip-crack and used it to perform a dictionary attack.
