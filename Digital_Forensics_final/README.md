This was the first question of the forensics section. There is a link to a file named cat.gz, which is a zip file. Upon unzipping, a file named **cat** is obtained. While checking the file type, it is identified to be in **MBR** format, which primarily indicates a **disk image**.

In the first question, the **MD5 hash value** of the **cat image file** is requested. I used my **Linux command shell** to find it, and I successfully obtained the hash value.
